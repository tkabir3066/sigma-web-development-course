                I'm a software engineer with over 6 years of experience,
                currently working at Amazon in USA as a SDE2. I earned my B.E.
                in Computer Science back in 2017. I have contributed to few
                open-source projects like FFMpeg and Netflix's VMAF. I'm a
                coding enthusiast who's tackled 1500+ LeetCode problems. My
                interests range from distributed systems to AI, and I'm always
                eager to explore new technological horizons. On a personal
                level, I'm passionate about self-improvement and personal
                growth. I believe that we can always learn and grow, both
                professionally and personally. I love reading books üìó and
                listening to podcasts üéôÔ∏è I'm excited to connect with fellow tech
                enthusiasts who share the same zeal for innovation and progress.
                Let's collaborate and make a positive impact together! I hope
                you have a lovely day! DISCLAIMER: All opinions shared by me are
